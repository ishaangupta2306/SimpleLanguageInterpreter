Includes:
- Variables, assignment statements, mathematical expressions, comparison operators, boolean operators, if statements, while statements, and return statements.
- "Goto" type constructs: break, continue, (true) return, and throw
- Function Definitions
- Classes and Objects (instances of classes)
